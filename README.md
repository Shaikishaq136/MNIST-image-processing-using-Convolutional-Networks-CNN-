# MNIST-image-processing-using-Convolutional-Networks-CNN-
Basically the description for this is we are using the data of mnist digits which are gray scale images and we want to divide them train and test dataset and evaluate the data on the test and gain the accuracy which provide us how well the model is expalinimg our data which we have trained..We have used several algorithms like CNN and VGG16..
